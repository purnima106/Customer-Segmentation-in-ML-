# Customer-Segmentation-in-ML-
Machine Learning Project on 𝘾𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙧 𝙎𝙚𝙜𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣!🔍

I used the 𝙆𝙈𝙚𝙖𝙣𝙨 clustering algorithm to uncover important patterns in customer data, helping to make smarter business decisions.

Key Highlights:
🔹 𝘾𝙡𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘼𝙡𝙜𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙢: Employed the robust KMeans algorithm to categorize customers based on their behavioral attributes and preferences.
🔹 𝘿𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙋𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙜: Implemented Min-Max scaling to ensure optimal performance and accuracy of the model.
🔹𝙀𝙡𝙗𝙤𝙬 𝙈𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙙 𝙑𝙞𝙨𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣
: Visualized the Elbow Method through Matplotlib, a pivotal step in determining the optimal number of clusters.
🔹 𝙈𝙤𝙙𝙚𝙡 𝙀𝙫𝙖𝙡𝙪𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣: Rigorous training and testing were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation model.
🔹 𝙒𝙚𝙗𝘼𝙥𝙥 𝘿𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙤𝙥𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩: Seamlessly integrated the model into a user-friendly web application, facilitating intuitive exploration of customer segments.
Stay tuned for more updates!🚀
